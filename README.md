- Big mart daily data - Sales prediction  

#The Problem Statement

The data experts at BigMart have collected sales data for more than 1000 products across 10 different stores in various cities. The aim is to build a predictive model to find out the sales of each product at a particular store. Create a model by which BigMArt can analyse and predict the outlet production sales
